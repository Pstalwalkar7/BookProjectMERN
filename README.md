## CRUD Operations in a virtual book store.

Learn MERN stack: Learning by Doing.


### Purpose of the project

This is a project where I am learning the MERN stack. 
While I have worked with these frameworks separately, I have not delved deep into them and worked on them from End-to-end as much as I'd like. 
Thus, this is a project where I intend to work quickly on learning the MERN stack.

The following are my focus points:
1. Speed. This is a project that I have wanted to work on for a long time, but has always been postponed. 
2. Learning by doing: Hands-on work with MERN stack, along with JS will help build expertise in this coveted tech stack.  
3. Abandoning code quality: While this goes against fundamental software development principles and my own views on the same, I am taking this stance to avoid any delays while working on this project. Like many personal projects, especially those at a small scale, this is an acceptable stance to take.
4. Daily commit principle: Commits to track my own progress, build accountability. It is a short deadline.


### Timeline

Deadline: 30th July. 6 Days. Intense focus expected.


### Important Steps

0. Setup Git Repo. 
1. In backend folder:
    1. npm init -y (Add package.json)
    2. adding "type": "module" to package.json.
    3. Install Express and Nodemon: npm i express nodemon. (Express for framework; Nodemon for auto-restarting server)
    4. Adding scripts: npm start, npm run dev etc.
    5. Add first route. A simple app.get('', () => {}) works.
    6. Connect to MongoDB. Use the connection string from mongoDB site while creating DB, create a variable in config.js and then proceed.
